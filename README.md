Code Structure
HTML (index.html): This file contains the main structure of the webpage, including headings, paragraphs, images, and navigation.
Technologies Used:
HTML5: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
CSS3: Styles the visual appearance of the web page.
Semantic elements like header, nav, main, section, article, p, and h2 are used for clear organization.
Navigation links use the href attribute to jump to specific sections within the page (anchor links).
CSS (style.css): This file contains the styles applied to the HTML elements.

Basic styles are defined for fonts, margins, padding, and colors.
The navigation bar is styled using flexbox for horizontal alignment.
Future Improvements
Responsiveness: The current design is not responsive for different screen sizes. I will add media queries in the CSS to adjust layouts for mobile and tablets.
Images: I will try to add alternative text descriptions (alt) to the images for accessibility.
Navigation: A navigation bar at the top allows users to jump to different sections of the webpage.
Sections: The content is divided into sections for better organization. Each section focuses on a specific aspect of Victoria Falls' history.
Images: Images are included to enhance the user experience.
Responsive Design: The code uses basic media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
Responsive Design:

I have now included a media query that targets screens with a maximum width of 768px (typically tablets and mobiles).
Within the media query, i have adjusted styles for header, h1, nav, li, and img to improve their layout and responsiveness on smaller screens.
I reduced padding in header for better space utilization.
Adjusted h1 font size for better readability.
Changed nav layout to a vertical column using flex-direction: column for better stacking on smaller screens.
Increased spacing between navigation links (li) for easier tapping on touch devices.
Made images responsive by setting max-width: 100% and display: block to ensure they scale proportionally and fill the available width on smaller screens.
Other Improvements:

The header background color uses rgba with an alpha value for a semi-transparent effect, which can be visually appealing.
